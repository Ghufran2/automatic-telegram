# Automatic-HeaderScanner
üîç Comprehensive Website Security Scanner üöÄ | Asynchronous crawler that checks security headers, cookies, dynamic content, and API endpoints for vulnerabilities. Perfect for automating security audits with high concurrency and efficiency! üíªüîê

This Python script implements a SecurityScanner class that performs security analysis on a website by scanning static and dynamic content, checking security headers, analyzing cookies, and identifying potential API endpoints. The script uses asynchronous operations to handle multiple URLs concurrently and efficiently. Here's a breakdown of the key features:

Concurrency Management: The scanner uses asyncio and a semaphore to limit the number of concurrent tasks and manage website scanning efficiently.

Web Content Extraction: It uses BeautifulSoup to extract links from static HTML content and Playwright for fetching dynamic content (e.g., content rendered by JavaScript).

Security Checks:

Security Headers: The script checks for the presence of security headers like HSTS, Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options.

Cookies: It validates cookies for proper flags such as HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite.

Robots.txt Handling: It respects robots.txt to avoid crawling URLs that are disallowed by the website.

API Endpoint Detection: It uses regular expressions to detect possible API endpoints based on URL patterns that may indicate REST, GraphQL, or SOAP APIs.

URL Processing: It handles URLs dynamically by joining relative links and skipping already visited URLs to avoid redundant scans.

Results: The script aggregates the security analysis into a structured dictionary, reporting issues related to headers, cookies, HSTS, CSP, and discovered API endpoints.

This script is highly extensible, allowing for customizable depth, concurrency, and specific security checks, making it ideal for comprehensive website security assessments and vulnerability scanning.
